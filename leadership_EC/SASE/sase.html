    <h1>Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers (SASE)</h1>
    I began my journey with SASE during my freshman year and ever since then, I have become a strong advocate for the AAPI community supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion at Stony Brook and beyond.

                <p>
                    After I got too old (just kidding), I wanted to continue my involvement with SASE and looked towards other options. I joined SASE Pro which shared the same missions but focused on those in industry.
