                <p>
                    I've always enjoyed helping others in anyway, and I found serving as a teaching assistant to be a great way of doing so. I love breaking down complex ideas and problems to smaller portions that are much easier to understand.
                    <ul>
                        <li> Hosted office hours to aid Students who needed extra help </li>
                        <li> Lead multiple review sessions before midterms and finals and created my own slides for students to review </li>
                        <li> Hosted weekly recitations to go over practice problems  </li>
                        <li> Co-hosted freshmen orientation class to drive engagement and interactions with Freshmen students </li>
