        <h2>Tools Used</h2>
        <p>
            I utilized various tools and technologies throughout the development of Explore X. Following the Software Development life cycle, my team started with a discovery stage. We then proceeded to creating a System Analysis, Use Case Model, User Interface Model, Data Model, and Software Model. Some of the key tools utilized during the process are:
            <ul>
                <li>Version Control: Git</li>
                <li>Project Management: Monday</li>
                <li>User Interface Model: Figma</li>
                <li>Software Modeling: Lucid Charts</li>
            </ul>
            Software Build Tools:
            <ul>
                <li>Programming Languages: Javascript</li>
                <li>Framework(s): Express, React</li>
                <li>Database: MongoDB (Mongoose) </li>
                <li>Tools/Libraries: Bcrypt, Crypto, Google Oauth2 </li>
            </ul>
