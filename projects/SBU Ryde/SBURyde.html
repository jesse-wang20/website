    <h1>SBU Ryde</h1>
    <p>This project is a part of Stony Brooks Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) Program which unites undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty members in multidisciplinary teams that work on long-term projects in research, design, innovation and entrepreneurship.
        I alongside 4 other Computer Science students founded SBU Ryde as a mobile application designed to revolutionize the way ride sharing is handled on university premises.
        Today, the team consists of 8 members and 1 alumni. Attached below is our pitch presentation used that summarizes our application and its goals.
