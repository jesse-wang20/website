    <h1>Autogen X Legion</h1>
    <p>This is my Honors software engineering project. Below is a presentation that I constructed and presented to other Computer Science Honors Students at Stony Brook University detailing what my project is about. This project is still currently a work in progress.</p>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            I am responsible for creating an adapter that takes the output of Autogen and feeds it to Legion and eventually to other parallel paradigm frameworks. This tool will help in the automatic execution of dynamic programs efficiently on distributed-memory machines.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            Autogen is an algorithm developed by our own professors at Stony Brook University that takes in dynamic programming problems and discovers “highly efficient cache-oblivious parallel recursive divide-and-conquer algorithms from inefficient descriptions of DP recurrences”. The paper that describes the Autogen algorithm is cited below.

            Legion is a data-centric parallel programming system for writing portable high-performance programs targeted at distributed heterogeneous architectures. The benefits of Legion include but are not limited to load balancing, distributed memory, GPU, and communication. Legion has the ability to automate many tedious tasks that programmers today face by correctly extracting task and data-level parallelism and moving data around complex memory hierarchies. Companies such as Nvidia and Meta have heavily invested in Legion.
